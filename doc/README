This is a very pre alpha version of a php framework.

The framework has a module structured concept based on a event distributor class
and some event handlers functions (call-back). See EVENT_HANDLER_DOC. 

This project is also a opportunity to get familiar with the pat classes (http://www.php-tools.de).
