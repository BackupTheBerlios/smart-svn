This is a very pre alpha version of a php framework.

The framework has a module structured concept based on a event distributor class
and some event handlers functions (call-back). See EVENT_HANDLER_DOC. 

Currently I'm working on a module set based on sqlite, which comes with this package.

MySql is not yet supported, so dont select it in setup.
