The template language is pure php. In templates you have to output the content of the variables assigned by the perform() methode of the related view class. All templates variables should be member of the $B object container and should be of the format:
<code>
    $B->tpl_xxx; 
</code>

You will find all templates in the **/templates_xyz** folder.  You are free to design your templates. The format of a template file name is:
**tpl.xxx.php**
Where xxx stands for the template name defined in the related view class variable $template.

You should include in the top of every template the php line:

<code>
<?php if (!defined('SF_SECURE_INCLUDE')) exit; ?>
</code>

With this line nobody can call directly a template from within a browser. This is a security issue.

You should be carefull to include as less as possible procedural code in templates. Try to do such jobs in the related view classes.
