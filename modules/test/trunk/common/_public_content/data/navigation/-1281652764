SMART is still alpha stuff. There was a lot of changes and redesigns since the first release. If the idea behind SMART would be successfull depends on several views.

OOP purists dont like the fact that SMART is partialy based on procedual code. The module event handlers and the system event distributors are based on simple global functions. But i cant see at this moment any advantage to change this concept. Critics about this issue are welcome.

<li>How flexible is SMART in order to other frameworks?</li>
<li>What is its performance comparing to other frameworks?</li>
<li>Its usability against other frameworks?</li>
