You will find here all documents which give you an overview of how SMART works. Its not complete but it should be possible to understand SMART's outline. Please use the [http://forum.open-publisher.net/ forum] for further questions.

Take a look at the following diagram. It show you SMART's main design. SMART, which is build on the Model-View-Controller principle, separate the bussines from the presentation logic. Or in other words; Data storage, accessing data, manipulating data, data presentation is done in clearly separated sections. Bad application design mix those sections with no clear plan, which leads into bad usable and unmaintainable code.
