Development of a php5 version of Smart has been started. 

Requirements:
* php5
* !MySql >= 4.1 for the modules

You will find in the trunk branch of the project repository a php5 version Smart. It's not the complete stuff but just the core to give you an impression of the way to go.

Here the repository checkout url:
svn://svn.berlios.de/smart/smartframe/trunk

First you have to create a mysql database. After that point your browser to the admin.php controller and follow the setup instructions. After the setup was successfull done you can switch to the public controller index.php.

The main goal of a php5 version of Smart is:
* A more clear implementation of the controllers and how they interact with the views
* Making use of exceptions to have more controle over the system if an error occurs
