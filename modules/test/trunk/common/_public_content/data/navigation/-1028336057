The test application little Jo, which you can download [./index.php?view=node&node=1147680337 here], comes with a few simple modules. It's a good starting point to learn how the system (SMART) works and it's an easy to use tool to manage a small site project and last but not least, a testing tool for SMART's active developers.

+++ default module
This module provide no action classes, which you can use to build a web project. It does nothing else than printing the welcome page of the admin interface.

+++ navigation module
This is the most complex module. It provide a couple of action classes to access, create and edit navigation nodes. And it provide an administration interface to manage such nodes. A node consists of a title and a body text. You can format the body text using [http://wiki.ciaweb.net/yawiki/index.php?area=Text_Wiki&page=WikiRules text_wikki markdown rules]. 
The node bodies are stored in flat files, which you can find in the /data/navigation folder. The nodes tree structure and titles are stored in the file /data/navigation/nodes.php.

+++ option module
In the administration interface of this module, you can edit some global options.
* Administrator email
* Site title and description, which you can include in the html header.
* Public web pages template folders. This module recognize if you added a new public template folder. You can select such a folder in this module. A template folder name must be of the format: **templates_xxx** in the root folder. This give you the posibility to create more than one layout for your project. Little Jo is delivered with 2 template folder layouts.
* Public view folders. It works the same way as the templates folders but with view classes.
* Cache. Here you can enable, disable and empty the cache. When creating new templates, it is recommanded to disable the cache.

**Tip:** When creating a new template set, select the root folder (empty select) as public template folder and store your new templates in the root folder. It is much simpler to handle included external html files (css, images, files) with a tool like Dreamweaver. After finishing the templates, move them into a template folder and select this folder in the option menu.

**Backup**
To backup your data you have only to make a copy of the /data folder.

+++ user module
In the administration interface of this module, you can manage users, which have access to the administration interface of little jo.
