Often i have this feeling when reading some forum threats, that MVC create more confusions than transparency. ([http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/showthread.php?t=239167 Example] of such a discussion.) One goal of SMART was to approaches this principle from a practical point of view and keep it simple but flexible. 

SMART and so "little Jo" stands on 3 feeds:
* Actions
* Views
* Templates

+++ Templates
The design of a web page is defined in templates. In templates, php is only used to output (echo) the demanded data. You should keep as much as possible procedural code out of templates. See: [?view=node&node=671673398 templates] doc for more details. The template language is php. Why not using a template engine like Smarty? see: [http://www.phppatterns.com/index.php/article/articleview/4/1/1/ Harry Fuecks] and [http://www.massassi.com/php/articles/template_engines/ Brian Lozier].

+++ Views
Here we assemble the demanded data and assign variables, which the templates need to output. Furthermore, here we define the template, which is associated with this view. Optionaly launching: authentication, prepend filters, append filters. Dont hit your head on the last items. Look at the [?view=node&node=-1203816644 views] doc for more details on this issue.

+++ Actions
The job of actions can be very different. But in a short cut: Here we accomplish the job request, which is directed to a [?view=node&node=1282041485 module]. All this low level job, which can be very complex and difficult. Ex.: accessing data store. As a template and view programmer you will use actions like black boxes through event functions. You only have to know what should going in to receive an expected result. Furthermore before an action works on a request, it validates the transfered data. More on this issue at the [?view=node&node=150196115 actions] doc.

+++ Events
One more point, which you should keep in mind are Events, which are the (super) glue that holds every thing in the system together. Events are always directed to module actions classes through an intermediat global function M().
 Example:
In a view, an event (ex.: get_childs) is directed to the module "navigation"; Job to execute: "give me all child nodes with status 2 (published) of the node ID defined in $_GET['node']". The event distributor loads the "navigation" module action class in
"modules/navigation/actions/class.action_navigation_get_childs.php"
, which makes a connection to the data store (database), push the requested data in an array $B->tpl_child_nodes. The template does nothing else than loop through this data array and output its content.

Here the event code of this example:
<code>
        M( MOD_NAVIGATION, 
           'get_childs', 
           array('result' => 'tpl_child_nodes',
                 'node'   => (int)$_GET['node'],
                 'status' => 2));
</code>

As you can see in this example, the view holds the contact with modules actions classes through events. You can put as much events as you want in views, which hold contacts with many different modules. See: [?view=node&node=-1373560185 events] doc.

+++ Including Smart in exsisting projects
It is possible to include Smart in existing php projects. Open your exsisting php project file and paste the following code in:
<code>
    define('SF_SECURE_INCLUDE', 1);
    // the file name of your exsisting project
    define('SF_CONTROLLER', 'my_other_project.php');
    // relative path to Smart
    define('SF_RELATIVE_PATH', '../path/to/smart/');
    // include Smart's front controller
    include(SF_RELATIVE_PATH . 'index.php');
</code>

You will find in Smart's root folder 3 front controller types:
++++ index.php 
Take this if you want to include the whole thing.
++++ index_inc_view.php 
smart without the admin section. just the public views and templates
++++ index_inc_noview.php
take this if you want to use only the action classes through the global event functions.
