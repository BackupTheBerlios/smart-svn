Smart PHP Framework install instructions
---------------------------------------------

If you downloaded only the raw framework you have to create or install at least a setup 
and a user module. The raw framework only manage modules. It has no build in 
high level functionalities.

If this package contains modules, you have to point your navigator to the folder
where you uploaded the extracted framework archive. A setup menu should appear.

Suggestions and bug reports are welcome.
