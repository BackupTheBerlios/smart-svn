Smart PHP Framework install instructions
---------------------------------------------

If you downloaded only the raw framework you have to create or install some modules. The raw framework only manage
modules. It has no build in high level application functionalities.

If downloaded the test package, you have to point your navigator to the folder
where you uploaded the extracted framework archive. A setup menu should appear.

Suggestions and bug reports are welcome.
